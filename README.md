## Prework study guide for students of the NW bootcamp 

This webpage is designed as a study tool for students of the North Western Bootcamp. In this guide, you will find hints and notes regarding HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript.

This website was built for myself and students alike to have a reference for knowledge and skills we will be learning and adapting along the course of our studies.

While creating thios guide, I instill useful practice methods that I will continue to nurish througout my growth as a developer.
